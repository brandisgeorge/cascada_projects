...still deciding what all the app will have....

The app has a User login and Signup page, a home page, details page for the modules, and also a configure/setup modules pages as of right now.

The backend of the app is being created using python along with django

The frontend of the app is being created using a designed figma wireframe, react native aand an expo framework... i think.
